# Edu's IoT Services

You can find the code under `src` and maybe some custom libraries under `lib` folder

## Description
This was made to manage a bunch of IoT crap withing the same source code, just "selecting" the right variables. At the end of the day this is just abandonware since [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) can do all this and more way easier.

## Donations
If you really liked it and feel like I deserve some money, you can buy me a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/EduFdezSoy) and I'll continue transforming caffeine into code!
